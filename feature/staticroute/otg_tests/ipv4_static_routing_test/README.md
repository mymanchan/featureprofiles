## Summary 

Validate static routing for a DUT.

## Procedure

*   Configure a DUT that has 4 interfaces to an ATE device configured with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses at both ends.
*   Configure ATE port-1 connected to DUT port-1, and ATE port 2-4 connected to DUT port 2-4 with the relevant IPv4 addresses.
*   Using the OpenConfig static routing configuration validate simple static routes for IPv4:
    *   Add a static route for an IPv4 prefix 10.0.0.0/24 that routes packets from ATE port 1 to the next-hop address on each ATE port 2-4
    *   Validate that packets are received at each ATE port 2-4 when sourced from ATE port 1.
